Analysis of fluids using Schlieren methods

There are two methods of comparison, one using a reference frame good for visualisation of laminar flow, the other uses the previous frame to compare movements and 
to measure speed.
Pixel_Graph is made to graph intensity of pixels on a given line. I used that graph to uncover the graph of how density changes with position.
